### üßπ Data Cleaning

**1. Split the array** into multiple parts using a separator
```sql
string_to_array(raw_review_text, ',<p') as array_split
```

**2. Turn them into a set of rows**:
```sql
unnest(array_split) as array_row
```
**3. Extract the reviews from the text part**:
```sql
, regexp_matches(part, '<svg[^>]*aria-label="([^"]+)"', 'g') as sentiment
, regexp_matches(part, '<span itemprop="reviewBody">([^<]+)</span>', 'g') AS sentiment_review
```

**4. Generated new columns** (each customer's review can have a positive and negative part as well)
| index | reviewer | ... | sentiment | sentiment_review |
|-------|---------|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| 4     | Sue   | ... | Positive  |"The view was great, the apartment furnished in a modern style and equipped with everything you may need. The apartment was clean. There is free, secure parking outside in the building‚Äôs parking lot or downstairs in the garage. Jan always responded promptly to all messages sent via Booking.com messenger.  " |
| 4     | Sue     | ... | Neutral   | "The building itself has a very musty smell in the hallway (despite being built in 1988), but the apartment itself smells good, which makes it bearable. When showering, the hot water goes off every 2-3 minutes for about 20-30 seconds and then only cold water comes out. The hot water then comes back again. This should be checked out. That is the only thing we didn‚Äôt like about the apartment. " |
